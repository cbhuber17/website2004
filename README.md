# Website 2004
My first experience with HTML4 back in 2004!  Website displays photos related to my Spain trip in 2004, information for the upcoming 2005 Thailand trip, and some articles on my undergrad experiences and sports.

Note: The orignial URL of the website in 2004 was: https://webdisk.ucalgary.ca/~cbhuber/public_html/html/spain2004.html
